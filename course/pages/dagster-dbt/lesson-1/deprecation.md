**Deprecation Notice**

This course was originally built around the Python-based integration of Dagster and dbt. With the introduction of [Dagster Components](https://docs.dagster.io/guides/build/components), connecting to a dbt project is now far more streamlined and beginner-friendly.

If you’re new to Dagster and dbt, we recommend starting with the simpler, component-based guides instead:

* [dbt integration](https://docs.dagster.io/integrations/libraries/dbt)
* [Dagster and dbt example](https://docs.dagster.io/examples/dbt)

If you’d like to explore Dagster internals and work directly with the Python APIs for the Dagster–dbt integration, you are still welcome to take this course. You’ll also receive a certificate upon completion.
